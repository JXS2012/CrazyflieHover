CrazyflieHover
==============

A basic frame for Crazyflie control loop, to run copy it to /crazyflie-clients-python/examples/basiclog.py
and run it in the same way as running other examples

This is a naive implementation of the Crazyflie python api. User should write their own feedbackControl function in _pid_z(self) function
